        SUBSCRIPTION TERMS
1. Free trial
We may offer a free trial subscription for service. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period.
2. Subscription
The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each week, month, 6 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the option selected by you at the time of purchase) until you cancel.
3. Payment method
Payment will be charged to the payment method you submitted at the time of purchase at confirmation of purchase. You authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fees to the payment method that you submit.
4. Cancellation
Canceling your subscription means that the automatic renewal will be disabled, but you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period. Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.
If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on App Store: You can cancel a free trial or a subscription anytime by turning-off autorenewal through your Apple ID account settings. To avoid being charged, cancel the subscription in your Apple ID account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or then-current subscription period. You alone can manage your subscriptions. Learn more about managing subscriptions (and how to cancel them) on Apple support page.
If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on Google Play: You can cancel a free trial or a subscription anytime by turning off auto-renewal through your Google Play account settings. To avoid being charged, cancel the subscription in your account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or then-current subscription period. You alone can manage your subscriptions. Learn more about managing subscriptions (and how to cancel them) on Google’s support page.
If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on our website: You can cancel a free trial or a subscription by contacting our support at anton@bytestreamapps.com or by clicking on “Cancel Subscription” button in your account on our website at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or then-current subscription period
5. Changes
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on the app and/or by sending you an email notification, or in other prominent way. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect.
6. Refunds
If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on App Store: If you are eligible for a refund, you’ll have to request it directly from Apple. To request a refund, follow these instructions from the Apple support page.
If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on Google Play: If you are eligible for a refund, you'll have to request it directly from Google. To request a refund, follow these instructions from the Google’s support page.
In both cases, we may provide certain data (e.g., your subscription status, account activity, and usage data) to the relevant App Store to assist in processing your refund request in a transparent and fair way. By using our Services, purchasing subscriptions via App Stores, and submitting a refund request through these platforms, you expressly consent to the sharing of the necessary account and usage data with the relevant App Store for this purpose.
If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on our website: Please refer to our Terms and Conditions of Use.
